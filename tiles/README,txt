It should be pretty easy to set these up.
Put the strf file in an images folder, and put the tileset png(s) in the tiles folder, in their own folder, like for example:
images/customtiles.strf
images/tiles/customtilesfolder/customtiles.png

if it's 2 images or more, put the 2nd image where the 1st image is.

have a good day
